### What I learned

List of things I learned doing this project:

  * Install and navigate WSL 2
  * Install Apach 2, setup virtual hosts
  * Create a git repository
  * Add , commit push on the main branch of a git project
  * Install Gulp
  * Compile SCSS into CSS with Gulp
  * Use of localhost:3000
  * Discovery of Web hosting services and deployment of my solution to this project

I have just brushed the surface of all those topics, learning just enough to get me started.
